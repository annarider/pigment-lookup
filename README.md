Paint manufacturers use creative marketing names for their paint colors, which can make it hard to track the _underlying_ pigments used. Paint formulations also change over time, such that the pigment used to create the paint color also changes. 

This project looks up the different paint names to allow for a quick comparison of the paints based on their pigment composition.       

The goal of this project is to allow the following: 
- Quick price comparison when purchasing paints on sale to ensure you are choosing the correct colors
- Ability to move from one brand to another seamlessly by identifying the comparable paint name based on your original paint's pigment 
- Experiment with mixing convenience colors by referencing the underlying pigments the manufacturer has used
