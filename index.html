    <h1>Pigment lookup</h1>
    <p>Use this database of pigments to look up a pigment and the corresponding color from different paint manufacturers. For example, the pigment code <strong>PY65</strong> is generically known as Arylide yellow and Hanza yellow. Da Vinci Paint Co. sells a single-pigment paint color with the PY65 pigment called <a href="https://davincipaints.com/arylide-yellow-deep-37ml-watercolor/" target="_blank" "rel="noopener">Arylide Yellow Deep</a> whereas Daniel Smith calls its version <a href="https://danielsmith.com/color-stories/watercolors/hansa-yellow-deep-watercolor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansa Yellow Deep</a>.</p> 
    <p>You can also look up a particular color from a paint manufacturer so you can find the comparable color from a different paint brand. For example, if you're used to using <a href="https://davincipaints.com/cobalt-blue-deep-15ml-watercolor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cobalt Blue Deep</a> from Da Vinci Paint Co. and want to try Daniel Smith paints, you can use this database to find the corresponding paint from Daniel Smith. Since Cobalt Blue Deep is made from the pigment <strong>PB28</strong>, you can use that information to learn that Daniel Smith calls its version of this color <a href="https://danielsmith.com/color-stories/watercolors/cobalt-blue-watercolor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cobalt Blue.</a></p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Many pigments can produce <em><strong>variations</strong></em> on a hue, such as the pigment PB28. For example, Da Vinci Paint Co. produces both <a href="https://davincipaints.com/cobalt-blue-37ml-watercolor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cobalt Blue</a> (aqua blue) and <a href="https://davincipaints.com/cobalt-blue-deep-15ml-watercolor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cobalt Blue Deep</a> (mid blue) from PB28. This database will allow you to see these variations so you can more precisely choose the correct color for you.</p>
